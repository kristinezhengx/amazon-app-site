In Flutter, screens and pages are called routes. Create two routes, Navigate to the second route using Navigator.push(), and then return to the first route using Navigator.pop() and you will have two pages to display information! The Navigator.push() method adds a route to the stack of routes managed by navigator and the Navigator.pop() method removes the current route from the stack. In your empty main.dart file, paste the following code provided by the Flutter Navigation docs import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; void main() { runApp(MyApp()); } class MyApp extends StatelessWidget { @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return MaterialApp( title: 'Amazon App', theme: ThemeData( primarySwatch: Colors.orange, visualDensity: VisualDensity.adaptivePlatformDensity, ), home: HomePage(), ); } } Then we want to create a folder within our lib directory called pages . This folder will hold the dart files containing the code for our content pages. Create three new dart files within this folder: home_page.dart , product_page.dart and user_page.dart . Paste the following code into each file, but change each of the 'HomePage' in the code to match the applicable file name. This is the basic skeleton and structure of each Flutter page. import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; class ProductPage extends StatefulWidget { ProductPage({Key? key}) : super(key: key); @override _ProductPageState createState() => _ProductPageState(); } class _ProductPageState extends State<ProductPage> { @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return Scaffold(); } } We also want to create the controllers and a 'on clicked' function called _onItemTapped to control clicking on our Nav Bar. PageController _pageController = PageController(); List<Widget> _screen = [IntroPage(), UserPage(), ProductPage()]; int _selectedIndex = 0; void _onPageChanged(int index) { setState(() { _selectedIndex = index; }); } void _onItemTapped(int selectedIndex) { _pageController.jumpToPage(selectedIndex); } And then initialize! return Scaffold( body: PageView( controller: _pageController, children: _screen, onPageChanged: _onPageChanged, physics: NeverScrollableScrollPhysics(), ), Once you've made the appropriate changes to your code, save main.dart, open a terminal to the tg_flutter folder and run flutter run -d chrome`. A Chrome browser will automatically open and run assuming there are no errors. Here you will find the web application with the navigation bar.

I will not explain the exact implementation, but the please watch the tutorial as it is very helpful! And reference the code provided in the repo. Side Note: After you make changes to your main.dart file, if you hit r in the terminal that the terminal the flutter app is running from, it will hot restart the changes you made while the app is still running!

Name it my-project . $ mkdir my-project $ cd my-project Flutter Now, to create a Flutter project, we first must fulfill the Flutter Requirements needed: Flutter SDK Chrome Optional: an IDE that supports Flutter. Visual Studio Code is used for this tutorial Follow the Building a Web Application with Flutter tutorial to get your machine set up with the Flutter SDK. IMPORTANT NOTE : The instructions provided by the Flutter Docs only sets your PATH variable for the current terminal window and not for future terminal windows. Follow these instructions to permanently add Flutter to your path. Create a new Flutter project with web support Run the following commands to get the latest version of Flutter $ flutter channel stable $ flutter upgrade And create and run a new Flutter project within the my-project directory. I named my flutter project tg_flutter . $ mkdir my-project $ cd my-project $ flutter create tg_flutter $ cd tg_flutter Serve your app from localhost in Chrome by running the following command from the main directory of the project, tg_flutter . $ flutter run -d chrome This launches the application using the development compiler in the Chrome browser. Middleware Requirements Python pip Create Middleware Directory In the my-project directory, create a new directory to hold the goods for the middleware. $ mkdir middleware $ cd middleware Your middleware and tg_flutter directories should sit next to each other in the my-project directory. Python Virtual Environment Create a virtual environment using venv and Python. $ python3 -m venv venv Activate the new virtual environment. $ source venv/bin/activate There should now be (venv) in front of your terminal after activating the virtual environment. Install Packages For the middleware, we will be using pyTigerGraph, FastAPI, and a library called uvicorn that is used by FastAPI $ pip install pyTigerGraph fastapi uvicorn What is FastAPI? FastAPI Setup Open the my-project directory in VS Code or your editor of choice, open the middleware folder, and create a file called main.py inside of it. Click into main.py and use code from FastAPI in that file. from typing import Optional from fastapi import FastAPI app = FastAPI() @app.get(\"/\") def read_root(): return {\"Hello\": \"World\"} Run the API Save main.py , open an integrated terminal in VS Code, and run the following command to run the API. $ uvicorn main:app --reload This is using uvicorn to run our file. The file name is main and the --reload has the server automatically relaod after new changes are saved to the main.py file.
