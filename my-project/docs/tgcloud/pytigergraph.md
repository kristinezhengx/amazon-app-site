# pyTigerGraph

Instead of using the GraphStudio GUI, you can also use the [pyTigerGraph library](https://pytigergraph.github.io/pyTigerGraph/GettingStarted/) to create the schema, load data, and write and install queries. 

See this [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iikZfPBzjFyi444kRW9CdHkuUYfWY5r_?usp=sharing)
* If you use this, make sure to change the graph name and host link to match your solution from tgcloud. Also, remember to download and unzip this [data file](https://github.com/mckenzie-steenson/amazon-app/blob/master/Amazon_Products_Reviews.csv.zip) to upload into the colab notebook.
