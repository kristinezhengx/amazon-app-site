So to begin setting up our environment, let's start by creating a project folder in a desired location that will hold the contents of our project. Name it `my-project`.

```
$ mkdir my-project
$ cd my-project
```

## Flutter
Now, to create a Flutter project, we first must fulfill the Flutter Requirements needed:

* Flutter SDK
* Chrome
* Optional: an IDE that supports Flutter. Visual Studio Code is used for this tutorial

Follow the [Building a Web Application with Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/web) tutorial to get your machine set up with the Flutter SDK.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The instructions provided by the Flutter Docs only sets your PATH variable for the current terminal window and not for future terminal windows. Follow [these](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50652071/flutter-command-not-found) instructions to permanently add Flutter to your path. 

### Create a new Flutter project with web support

Run the following commands to get the latest version of Flutter

```
$ flutter channel stable
$ flutter upgrade
```

And create and run a new Flutter project within the my-project directory. I named my flutter project `tg_flutter`.

```
$ mkdir my-project
$ cd my-project
$ flutter create tg_flutter
$ cd tg_flutter
```

Serve your app from localhost in Chrome by running the following command from the main directory of the project, `tg_flutter`.

```
$ flutter run -d chrome
```

This launches the application using the development compiler in the Chrome browser.

## Middleware

Requirements

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

## Create Middleware Directory

In the `my-project` directory, create a new directory to hold the goods for the middleware.

```
$ mkdir middleware
$ cd middleware
```

Your `middleware` and `tg_flutter` directories should sit next to each other in the `my-project` directory.

### Python Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment using venv and Python.

```
$ python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the new virtual environment.

```
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

There should now be (venv) in front of your terminal after activating the virtual environment. 

### Install Packages

For the middleware, we will be using pyTigerGraph, FastAPI, and a library called uvicorn that is used by FastAPI

```
$ pip install pyTigerGraph fastapi uvicorn
```

*[What is FastAPI?](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)*

### FastAPI Setup

Open the `my-project` directory in VS Code or your editor of choice, open the `middleware` folder, and create a file called `main.py` inside of it.

Click into `main.py` and use code from FastAPI in that file.

```python
from typing import Optional
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()
@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"Hello": "World"}
```

### Run the API

Save `main.py`, open an integrated terminal in VS Code, and run the following command to run the API.

```
$ uvicorn main:app --reload
```

This is using uvicorn to run our file. The file name is `main` and the `--reload` has the server automatically relaod after new changes are saved to the `main.py` file.

### Explore the Endpoints

Now it's time to check out the endpoints that were just created! Enter [https://127.0.0.1:8000](https://127.0.0.1:8000) in a browser page, and here you should find the {“Hello”: “World”} from the first function in the `main.py` file

Enter [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs) or [http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc](http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc) to find interactive documentation for the endpoints we created. Thanks fastAPI!

We will learn how to connect to our TigerGraph solution in the [Middleware](middleware.md) section.
